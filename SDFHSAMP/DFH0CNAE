      * The interface to the Error Handler program is described in a

      * area designed to be in character format to enable ease of
      * translation when the program is invoked from a remote system
      * which uses a different encoding scheme (e.g., ASCII) than the
      * EBCDIC of the mainframe.
      *
      * This is the linkage commarea version of the interface to the
      * Error Handler program.

           05  CA-ERRH-ERROR-COMMAREA.
      *
      * This is an "Eyecatcher" and integrity check field.

      *
      * The error field is designed to conform to the CICS EIBRESP
      * characteristics which always contains a numeric value. There
      * are also architected values to indicate errors detected by the
      * various programs in the applications suite.

      * Since the Error Handler can be LINKed or XCTLed to as well as

      * Handler to use the information in a manner it deems suitable.
