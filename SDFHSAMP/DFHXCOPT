* DESCRIPTION                                                         *
*         This sample table should be used to pass options to the     *
*         EXCI interface. There is no suffixed version of this table, *
*         DFHXCPRH will load the first DFHXCOPT it finds in the       *
*         STEPLIB concatenation.                                      *
*                                                                     *
*         The permitted options are:                                  *
*                                                                     *
*           TIMEOUT:    Specifies (in hundredths of a second) how     *
*                       long DFHXCPRH will wait for a DPL call to     *
*                       complete. The default is ZERO which will wait *
*                       indefinitely.                                 *
*                                                                     *
*           TRACE:      Specifies if internal tracing is required,    *
*                       and if so, the level of tracing.              *
*                       Acceptable values are OFF, 1 and 2.           *
*                       OFF: Only exception trace entries will be     *
*                            written to the internal trace table.     *
*                       1  : Exception and level 1 entries will be    *
*                            written to the internal trace table.     *
*                       2  : Exception, level 1 and level 2 entries   *
*                            will be written to the internal trace    *
*                            table.                                   *
*                       3  : Exception, level 1, 2 and level 3 entries*
*                            will be written to the internal trace    *
*                            table.                                   *
*                       The default for the TRACE parameter is OFF    *
*                                                                     *
*           TRACESZE:   The size (in K) of the internal trace table.  *
*                       This should still be specified, even for      *
*                       TRACE=OFF because exception trace entries     *
*                       will still be be written. The default trace   *
*                       table size is 16K, which is also the minimum. *
*                                                                     *
*           DURETRY:    Specifies (in seconds) the length of time     *

*                       take an SDUMP, should one occur, and SDUMP    *
*                       is busy. An attempt will be made every 5      *
*                       seconds, up to the DURETRY time.              *
*                       The default for DURETRY is 30 seconds.        *
*                                                                     *
*           TRAP:       Specifies if the service module DFHXCTRA is   *
*                       to be used. Acceptable values are ON and OFF, *
*                       the default being OFF.                        *
*                                                                     *
*           GTF:        Specifies that all trace entries that would   *
*                       normally be written to the internal trace     *
*                       table are ALSO written to GTF, if GTF tracing *
*                       is active. Acceptable values are ON and OFF,  *
*                       the default being OFF.                        *
*                                                                     *
*           MSGCASE:    Specifies whether messages should be output   *
*                       in mixed case, or uppercase. Allowable values *
*                       are MIXED and UPPER. The default is MIXED.    *
*                                                                     *

*           CICSSVC:    Specifies the CICS type 3 SVC number being    *
*                       used for MRO communication.                   *
*                       Values can be 0, or a number in the range     *
*                       200 - 255 inclusive. The default is 216.      *
*                                                                     *
*                       The value 0 means that the External CICS      *
*                       Interface will obtain the CICS SVC number     *
*                       being used for MRO by means of an SSI VERIFY  *
*                       request.
*                                                                     *
*                       If no MRO CICS regions have ever logged on to *
*                       DFHIRP in the local MVS during the life of    *
*                       the IPL, you must specify a non zero SVC      *
*                       number. If you specify 0 the External CICS    *
*                       Interface requests the SVC from MVS which     *
*                       will fail if no CICS region has logged on to  *
*                       DFHIRP.                                       *
*                                                                     *
*                       A non zero value is required in MVS images    *
*                       that do not run any CICS regions, and the     *
*                       client program is issuing DPL requests to a   *
*                       server CICS region that resides in another    *
*                       MVS. In these circumstances, the client       *
*                       program logs on to the local DFHIRP using the *
*                       locally defined SVC and communicates with the *
*                       remote CICS region using XCF/MRO.             *
*                                                                     *
*                       THE LATEST CICS RELEASE LEVEL OF THE CICS SVC *
*                       (DFHCSVC) SHOULD ALWAYS BE USED BY ALL CICS   *
*                       SYSTEMS USING MRO IN THE SAME MVS, OR BY EXCI *
*                       BATCH PROGRAMS IN THAT SAME MVS.              *
*                                                                     *
*           CONFDATA:   Specifies whether or not to allow commarea    *
*                       data to be output in an EXCI trace given that *
*                       the data may be classified in nature.         *
*                       Acceptable values are SHOW and HIDETC with    *
*                       SHOW being the default.                       *
*                       SHOW means do not supress the trace data.     *
*                       HIDETC means suppress the trace data.         *
*                                                                     *
*           ABENDBKOUT: Specifies whether a transactional EXCI        *
*                       task is to force a rollback of the            *
*                       global uow after an abend.                    *
*                       DFHMIRS will invoke RM to call MVS RRS        *

*                                                                     *

*                       coupling facility (XCF) group to be joined    *
*                       by the client program. The default XCF        *
